job_queue
=========

This is an answer to the fact that Pool() isn't working how I need it to for a
project. So I made a super simple running queue, that has a bubble of
execution.


Requires
========

python 2.5 with 3rd party install or >2.6, and the mutltiprocessing module, as 
it takes Process()es as its queue members.
